**Kuaipedia** is developed by [Kuaishou Technology](https://www.kuaishou.com/en), collaborating with HIT and HKUST. It is the world's first large-scale multi-modal short-video encyclopedia where the primitive units are items, aspects, and short videos.

* **Items** is a set of entities and concepts, such as [Shiba Inu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiba_Inu), [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon) and [Galileo Galilei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei), which can be edited at one Wikipedia page. An item may have a title, a subtitle, a summary, attributes, and other detailed information of the item.
* **Aspects** is a set of keywords or keyphrases attached to items. Those keywords are used to describe specific aspects of the item. For example, "selection", "food-protecting", "color" of item [Shiba Inu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiba_Inu), or "formation", "surface conditions", "how-to-draw" of item [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon).
* **Videos** is a set of short-videos whose duration may not exceed 5 minutes. In this paper, we only focus on knowledge videos we detected, Where we follow OECD to define knowledge as:
    * *Know-what* refers to knowledge about facts. E.g. How many people live in New York? 
    * *Know-why* refers to scientific knowledge of the principles and laws of nature. E.g. Why does the earth revolve around the sun?
    * *Know-how* refers to skills or the capability to do something. E.g. How to cook bacon in the oven.

Please refer to the paper for more details.
